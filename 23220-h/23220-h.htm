      THE GRAY NUN
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Nataly Von Eschstruth
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Translated from the German by Lionel Strachey
    </h3>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a young man I once made a foreign journey, betaking myself to
      the royal court of X. on affairs of state. In those days politics would
      take strange turns, not of unmixed delight, and so it happened that my
      mission was prolonged well into the winter, and kept me at X. until the
      carnival season. But at this I did not repine, for to pass a winter in a
      beautiful climate and amid the fascinating society of a court seemed a
      welcome change to my enthusiastic, pleasure-loving young soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reigning sovereign had a predilection for masked balls,&mdash;a
      traditionally favorite amusement at the palace, I was told&mdash;and
      accordingly several fancy dress festivities were enacted on the royal
      premises during the carnival. The first I was unable to participate in
      because of an inflamed eye, and therefore awaited the second with all the
      keener anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the becoming costume of a Prussian officer in the army of Frederick the
      Great, and with the agreeable sensation of being specially well disguised
      beneath my mask and safe from recognition, I mingled in the gay throng of
      the dancers and enjoyed to the full the charm of the brilliant and
      delicious event. An exquisitely graceful little water-nix had conquered my
      heart. The champagne was bubbling in my blood, and in wild spirits I was
      pursuing the fleeing Undine into an adjacent apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I stopped as though spellbound, and found myself staring into a
      pair of dark eyes, black as night, which were rigidly fixed upon me.
      Standing aloof, in a corner of the room, I saw a nun. Her long gray
      garment reached to the ground, and lay about her very feet in folds like a
      train. Her arms hung straight down, the hands being concealed in the loose
      sleeves. White linen bands covered her head and chin, and rendered even
      her mouth invisible, while her forehead and the upper part of her face
      were protected by a black velvet mask. And the blackness of those eyes
      that penetrated me was so intense that scarcely were any whites
      discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable emotion ran over me as I stood under the ban of an evil
      power, as it were, returning the look of that strange figure. I had
      forgotten Undine. Drawn by some invisible force, I approached the nun with
      mechanical footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, fair mask," I accosted her with a bold laugh, "are you alone? Surely
      you know that for dancing and love two are needed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly, like a Chinese idol, she nodded her head in assent; a thrill
      seemed to pass over her wonderfully slender shape; yet she did not budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became more venturesome from a sudden feeling as of fire rushing through
      my veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be vowed to seclusion, beautiful bride of Heaven, but to-day the
      convent walls have released you, to-day you are of the world and the
      flesh, to-day you are mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I cried aloud, forgetting in my excitement that I was in a country
      where my mother tongue was only spoken and understood at the German
      legation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment it occurred to me: Did the mask know German?
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment, she gave an immediate sign of intelligence by gliding,
      silently as a shadow, another step in my direction, and her biasing eyes
      appeared to kindle with merriment. Had she a veil over her eyes? It almost
      looked so and this extraordinary measure of precaution challenged me the
      more strongly to overcome her reluctance to being known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you understand me?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded in the same brief, jerky manner as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly she answered by negative motions of the head. I stepped up close
      to her with the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will you not know me and love me? Come into my arms, and let us
      dance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened that at the moment I found surprising and
      extremely startling, yet which I took for a mere carnival freak, while
      later on I could scarce review the occurrence with any degree of
      clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nun threw her arms about me abruptly and almost desperately, and
      whirled me into a frenzied dance. I felt no body between my arms, and did
      not hear the rustle of her dress; I only saw those enigmatic dark eyes,
      which glowed near, very near, my own. And in mad career, regardless of the
      musical time or of the tune played, my curious partner tore around the
      room with me faster and faster, and with ever increasing fury. Her arms
      gripped me tighter and tighter and I was threatened with complete loss of
      breath in the wild race. Of a sudden I received a violent blow, resembling
      an electric shock, from each of her hands on my shoulders, felt myself all
      at once liberated, and staggered faint against a pyramid of plants.
      Boisterous laughter sounded on my ear; some other masks had surrounded and
      seized me, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the fine gentleman! He is out of his mind, dancing about the room
      like a madman, quite alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened my eyes and looked all around. What had become of my partner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sign of her was to be seen, although this other room was likewise
      very large, just then not well filled with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I been dancing alone?" I gasped, tearing the mask off my burning
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite alone! Did you imagine it was with your sweetheart?" was the
      mocking, noisy reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was deeply annoyed. "Nonsense!" I cried. "You are all in the conspiracy!
      Where has the nun gone? It was no lady at all, it was a man in disguise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed still more, and some whispered behind fans that I must be
      drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange sensations invaded me. Had a joke been played at my expense? Had a
      member of the German legation dressed in female clothes, and in the height
      of his whimsical caprice danced with me in that insane fashion? Were the
      guests in the secret, and were they amusing themselves&mdash;as the
      freedom of the carnival permitted&mdash;with teasing a foreigner? Yet
      surely the mysterious nun must be discoverable. My knees were trembling
      from a weakness I was unable to account for, but I collected myself, and
      while various thoughts coursed through my brain for a solution of this
      carnival prank, I hastened with feverish speed through rooms and galleries
      in quest of the nun. But in vain. I espied neither herself, nor met anyone
      who had seen her. The lackeys and doorkeepers assured me in perfect good
      faith that they had seen no nun of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The costume is one of which His Majesty does not approve," I was informed
      in the cloak-room. "It is considered irreverent to appear at balls here in
      the spiritual garb of a nun or a monk, and therefore it is not done. It
      would certainly have been observed by us had any lady or gentleman
      transgressed against the prevailing usage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then perhaps I may have mistaken for a nun some other mask, who intended
      in her gray suit to represent Twilight or Care," I excused myself
      hesitatingly, though I had an accurate eye for dresses, and could have
      registered a solemn oath that the mysterious unknown was even wearing
      especially authentic claustral attire. No one, however, could by any
      effort remember having noticed a costume anything like that described by
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there any secret passages to any of the rooms and galleries which are
      the scene of tonight's festivities?" I asked a doorkeeper. He looked at me
      in surprise, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ways of communication were opened today because of the crowd of
      guests, but for safety's sake guarded and watched more carefully than
      usual. Only the tapestried corridor running the length of the great
      colonnade to the royal apartments was left unguarded, since in that place
      there is no possibility of improper intrusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      A new idea flashed across me. The spot on which I had first set eyes on my
      nun was at the entrance to that corridor. Might not a member of the royal
      family have elected to make me, as a novice in this foreign court society,
      the subject of a merry jest? No doubt the nun was a man in disguise, and
      the young princes and dukes were probably capable of pouncing on the
      victim and dancing him to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      My confusion was perhaps very diverting, and the secrecy of the few
      spectators of the joke, who were, of course, initiated, was quite
      praiseworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They asserted not having seen a nun at all, and laughed at me for having
      rushed round the room alone, like a lunatic, Obviously there was no
      further room for doubt, this explanation and no other was valid. Why had I
      not thought of this before!
    </p>
    <p>
      So I joined in the hilarity of the others and made the best of my
      discomfiture. In any case, the manner in which my partner had dismissed me
      betrayed a pair of powerful masculine fists! My shoulders, on which she
      had come down so vigorously ached as if they were broken, and I was still
      unable to conquer entirely a peculiar sensation of uneasiness. But while I
      was pursuing my investigations the clock struck twelve, the company
      unmasked, and gaily flocked toward the Supper rooms. I felt particularly
      entitled to refreshments, and in the course of my indulgence in the good
      things of my selection, my faintness&mdash;which was more astonishing to
      my robust, muscular young self than any carnival joke in the world could
      have been&mdash;passed off completely. I was as happy and lively as
      before, and enjoyed the remainder of the ball as much as I had the
      beginning. I tried to dismiss the episode from my mind. For a few days I
      felt a dull pain in my shoulders, which annoyed me at night also, and
      disturbed my sleep. The image of the nun haunted me, and the sombre,
      penetrating eyes were present to me in my very dreams. This vexed me, and
      I mentally abused the royal gentleman in every key who had pushed his joke
      rather too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed, and the court chamberlain issued invitations for the third
      masked ball at the palace. I purchased a sailor's dress, and on the
      evening of the ball tripped up the marble stairs in the best of spirits.
      It had in the meanwhile occurred to me that I had perhaps imbibed too
      much, and that the prince in nun's clothing had perhaps observed my
      condition, and made me his victim for that reason. But I rejected that
      proposition. In the first place, I had not taken much to drink; certainly
      two or three glasses of champagne and lemonade were not worth mentioning
      when I remembered what quantities of alcohol I had frequently absorbed in
      my university days in Germany. I was a brave boon companion, and capable
      of consuming a great deal. So how should a few paltry little glasses make
      me so unsteady on my feet as to collapse in dancing a fast gallop? Absurd!
      I was sure enough of myself, and sufficiently well brought up in social
      customs, to know how much one may drink at a court ball. No&mdash;I was
      convinced that I had not been intoxicated, but on this occasion I resolved
      to exercise special caution, and to be strictly temperate, in the event of
      the disguised perpetrator of pranks again attempting to make the German
      stranger the butt of his impudence. This time he should meet his match; I
      would keep my head clear and my feet steady enough to venture a dance with
      him. The constantly suspicious attitude of my mind, to be sure, interfered
      with my pleasure very considerably. I was in a too observant mood to float
      on the topmost wave of enjoyment, and besides an extraordinary disquietude
      had seized upon me, a contraction about the heart that was quite new to
      me, such as sensitive people undergo before a storm or in anticipation of
      momentous changes of fortune. I wandered about restlessly. Numerous though
      the merry masks that flitted around me, that nun's indescribable black
      eyes did not appear, and no effort was made to involve me again as the
      hero of another frolic. Time was dragging heavily. I glanced at my watch,
      and wished the supper hour might be near. The finger only pointed to half
      past eleven, so that I must still possess my soul in patience for half an
      hour. It was a lovely, mild, moonlight night; the doors to the tapestried
      passage and the colonnade had been thrown open, and I concluded to take a
      breath of the fragrant air and a rapid view of the illuminated town in its
      festive brilliancy of a carnival night.
    </p>
    <p>
      A female pierrot dances past me with Don Juan, and, with a laugh, throws a
      handful of confetti in my face. I retaliate&mdash;a few phrases are
      exchanged&mdash;I look after her for a moment&mdash;and then turn to the
      entrance of the corridor, to get out into the colonnade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am rooted to the ground!
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing aside in a corner, on the very same spot as before, is my nun,
      staring at me with the same unfathomable eyes as a week ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had she come from?
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the ground? Or had she slipped in through the door during my banter
      with the pierrot?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come through the door, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am utterly amazed. The same costume. The same joke. How clumsy of the
      prince to repeat himself, I am inclined to ignore the impertinent young
      gentleman, and pass him proudly by&mdash;yet&mdash;strange&mdash;again I
      am attracted irresistibly, as by a supernatural power, held by those black
      orbs. I am quite certain of my wits this time: the dress is really the
      forbidden costume of a nun, and, so far as I can judge, exact in every
      particular. On her breast hangs a large cross, which is especially
      conspicuous. It is of dull gold, with emeralds and pearls inlaid, of
      peculiar shape, and certainly antique. The pious nun seems to have regaled
      herself with excessive haste at some sideboard, since the white collar and
      the front of the gray bodice show oblong dark stains, as though some
      beverage had been spilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, fair mask," finally remark in a mocking tone, although my heart is
      beating furiously, "you have been waiting for me here, I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nods slowly and solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you imagine, by chance, that I wish to dance another hurricane with
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she assents, but more emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," say I, ironically, "see where you can find a new blockhead, my
      muscular fairy! My shoulders are not well yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arms move&mdash;hands there are none visible in the long, roomy
      sleeves&mdash;they are stretched out to me as if in mute appeal. A cold
      shiver runs down my back, I know not why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I dance with you again," I angrily exclaim, "you will not fare quite
      so well as last time! I am firmer on my feet to-night than I was last
      week!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She presses her arms to her breast, something like a tremor agitates the
      gray shape, and her head is slightly raised. Her position and demeanor,
      though she utters not a word, denote intense longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushes to my head&mdash;I must go a step nearer to her&mdash;I
      must!
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I dance with you, it will be only on one condition!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a profound sigh her bosom heaves, her arms fall to her side, her body
      is humbly bent forward as if in complete surrender, and as if to say: Ask
      what you will!
    </p>
    <p>
      "My condition is that you afterward reveal yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nods stiffly, like a marionette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raises her arm for the oath, but the gray folds still conceal her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woe betide you if you deceive me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shakes her head, and repeats the passionate gesture of entreaty. Her
      slender form trembles with feverish impatience, and the wonderful eyes
      seem to plead, in extreme urgency: Come quickly!
    </p>
    <p>
      I put out my arms&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more does the terrible woman rush at me, once more am I held in that
      mad embrace, once more&mdash;on the wings of the wind&mdash;do we dash
      round the room! And once more are all my senses lost in the fiendish
      whirl!
    </p>
    <p>
      I attempt to struggle, would pit the abounding strength of my youth
      against the woman and subdue her. In vain! I can think, I can act, no
      longer. My whole being is in a swoon, and I am conscious of nothing but
      two icy lips pressed upon mine with a vehemence calculated to draw my very
      life out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder seizes me, and the fear of death, and then&mdash;again that blow
      on my shoulders&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel as if a pair of iron clamps had been taken off me and I had been
      freed, and I sink down upon a sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      A laughing, jeering crowd surrounds me, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sailor is crazy! He has gone out of his mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I again been dancing alone in public?
    </p>
    <p>
      I jump up in a rage, and exclaim, as I toss back my dishevelled hair from
      my burning brow:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abominable trickery! Let me pass! Let me get my hands on her, and unmask
      her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something rings on the floor. It has fallen from my hand, hitherto
      clenched and just now opened. Triumphantly I snatch it up, exulting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her cross! Ha! that shall be my clue!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, too, no trace of the mysterious nun was to be found. It
      was at first superciliously assumed, as before, that I must be drunk or
      insane, but my serious mood and energetic investigations soon altered that
      notion. I might myself have doubted my mental soundness had it not been
      for the cross in my hand, which I at once recognized as being that worn by
      the nun, and had not a lackey finally confessed to having beheld the
      strange figure. He was coming from the colonnade with a tray of
      refreshments when he saw me in conversation with her. The mask had
      something familiar about her, he said, but he could not remember where he
      had seen her before. He had been a servant in the palace for forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody thought of a spectre; on the other hand extravagant speculations
      became rife of a conspirator being at work. It was rumored the king had
      originally intended to wear a sailor costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it was him the uncanny visitor had designs upon. In view of the
      fact that the political horizon was very dark and clouded at that time,
      the conjecture was perhaps not altogether phantastical, and for this
      reason the report quickly reached the ears of the king and the royal
      family. I was promptly summoned before His Majesty, and it gave me a sort
      of revengeful pleasure to relate the incident to that august person. For I
      was still fully persuaded that some young member of his family had played
      this obnoxious trick upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded thoughtfully upon my frank declaration that, according to
      my researches, the enigmatical female could only have come from the royal
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said his Majesty:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask you, my dear Baron, to show me the cross you found?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I put it into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the king stared upon it speechless. Then he turned it over,
      and ejaculated, roughly almost under the emotion of his violent surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God&mdash;why&mdash;it is&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed to the small, delicately engraved initials, surmounted by a
      crown, in the middle of the cross. Very pale and with heaving breast he
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nun, a gray nun, you say? What would the object of such a joke be? and
      how&mdash;how should this cross come back among the living? Baron, come
      with me, I must request your confidence and secrecy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed through several rooms, and then arrived at a narrow gallery
      whose walls were hung with portraits of royal personages. The king came
      abruptly to a halt, and without himself looking up indicated a certain
      picture:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Observe that painting! Do you see the same Cross there that you have in
      your hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily I uttered the loud cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that is she! Holy Heavens! It is my nun!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cross&mdash;compare the cross!" urged the king, his slender, white
      hand trembling with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frosty current ran through my veins as I compared the pictured cross
      with that in my companion's hand. It was the same&mdash;not a doubt of it&mdash;and
      the eyes, too, were the same, as also the dress and the whole figure were
      unmistakably those of the gray nun I had danced with. Yet in those
      conspicuously large, deep black eyes lay not an expression of peacefulness
      and mild resignation, but a world of passionate feeling. Having assured
      the king of the identity of the cross, and he having informed me that it
      was an ancient heirloom of which no duplicate existed, he bade me
      accompany him further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the antechamber to his apartments, the king gave an order to
      one of the attendants on duty there. He walked up and down the room for a
      few moments in visible excitement, and then, stopping before me, and
      looking at me searchingly, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever, in the course of your life, met with a manifestation of
      the supernatural?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so bewildered and nervous that I scarcely could remember enough
      French to reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May it please your Majesty, I have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you believe in the possibility of the dead returning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the sense of their coming as apparitions. I always was, still am,
      a skeptic on the point of ghost stories in general, nevertheless I am a
      Christian, and I believe and know that we continue to live after death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king stared at me mechanically:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a Protestant, and you say you are a skeptic. Curious&mdash;only
      you saw the apparition&mdash;it was revealed to no one else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your Majesty is of the opinion that this is actually a case of a
      spectral apparition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. It seems much more plausible than open theft. This very cross
      I myself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted his sentence as he turned to the door, through which, with
      profound obeisances, entered two ladies in waiting&mdash;probably the
      queen's. His Majesty addressed one of them in French, no doubt to enable
      me to participate in the conversation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were present, Madame M., when Princess A. was laid in her coffin
      seventeen years ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A low curtsey was the affirmative reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you also, Madame U.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had the honor, your Majesty, of rendering her royal highness the last
      earthly services."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember perfectly what dress the deceased was buried in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well, your Majesty. It was the regular dress of the Order of Gray
      Sisters, of which her royal highness was a member."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you recollect whether she took any ornaments to her last resting
      place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excepting the golden cross which your Majesty hung round her neck on the
      day she took the vow, no jewelry was put on the princess. The duchess even
      drew the little sapphire ring from her royal highness' finger, to keep it
      as a remembrance and wear it herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are absolutely certain that the cross went into the coffin? You could
      swear to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could do so with fullest conviction, your Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you recognize the cross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens&mdash;it is! On the back there ought to be the initials of
      her royal highness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are," said the king, reversing the cross. The old woman shrank
      back appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, your Majesty, the vault has been broken into!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly it has. The matter shall be investigated. I am much obliged to
      you, ladies, and earnestly request you will both preserve unconditional
      silence as to our present interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the king to me, after the ladies in waiting had withdrawn,
      "how do you account for this cross being here in my hand, considering it
      was put into the coffin? You think the vault may have been pillaged? That,
      I believe, is out of the question. The object of a carnival freak, which
      could have been perpetrated just as easily in any other dress, is far too
      slight to make such a horrible offense as the violation of the dead worth
      while! But I intend to have the vault examined, and beg, my dear baron,
      that you will attend. For the present, good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a dreadful night, torturing my sleepless brain for a solution of
      the riddle, and being forever haunted by the nun's dark eyes. It was late
      when I woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours after, the coffin was opened in the presence of the king, whose
      surmise proved correct. The bolts on the coffin were intact. The gold
      chain was there, safe round the princess' neck. But the cross was gone.
      There was not the remotest sign of violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I got out of that vault, I do not know. I remember feeling faint, and
      being supported by two court officials. I am unaware of what happened
      next. It was the only instance in my life in which my system had so
      entirely given way. A serious illness was apprehended, but my strong
      constitution won the day. For a long time my mind was in a precarious
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had recovered, the king sent for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you still a skeptic?" he asked in a grave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, your Majesty, I am convinced now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the king himself deigned to communicate to me the particulars
      relating to the golden cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess A. was a daughter of one of his cousins, and she was their fifth
      child. The duchess, a very pious woman, made a vow before the birth of her
      sixth child, that if it was a boy, her youngest daughter should be
      dedicated to the service of the church and take the veil. A son was born,
      and Princess A. henceforth was educated for the profession of a nun in
      becoming retirement and seclusion. Unfortunately, however, the natural
      traits of the girl seemed to be entirely in opposition to that reverend
      calling. An irrepressible vivacity of spirit, an intense coveting of
      worldly joys and pleasures characterized her, and the more she was
      separated from the world the more ardent grew her desire to live in it.
      Heartrending scenes of resistance and tears were enacted, and the reigning
      sovereign felt so much pity for the spirited young creature that he
      attempted to save her from her fate of being immured in convent walls by
      offering to apply to the pope for a dispensation releasing the mother from
      her promise. But the duchess desperately combated this idea. Her wild
      laments, that to break her vow would entail her forfeiture of eternal
      salvation, her protestations, her tears, her entreaties, at last prevailed
      upon the princess to join the Order of the Gray Sisters. For a short space
      all seemed to go well. The fervid heart of the royal nun was apparently
      beating placidly, in the quiet claustral surroundings. But during the
      winter the duchess fell sick, and the young bride of the church was called
      to her bedside. Princess A. had remained with her mother for several
      weeks, and about that time the carnival season began. Masked balls were
      given in the palace, and while the horns and violins were sounding in the
      ballroom Princess A. lay on her knees in the throes of dreadful despair,
      tearing her hair in furious longing for that lost paradise. She at last
      succeeded in bribing a chambermaid to secretly procure her a fancy dress.
      If it was to cost her immortal soul, once she would dance and be young and
      happy! The plot was betrayed, and the angriest reproaches were poured out
      by her parents upon the perjured, rebellious nun! Princess A. was locked
      up, and was to be removed to the convent the next day. However, as the
      festivities in the palace were reaching their height that night, the
      unhappy young nun lay expiring in her room. She had taken poison, although
      the report was spread in the capital that failure of the heart had caused
      her death. How she came into possession of the poison no one ever
      discovered. While she was writhing in terrible agony her half-crazed
      mother put a cup of milk to her lips as an antidote. She dashed it
      passionately aside and the spilt milk left stains on her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      How hard it was to die! Again and again she tore her black hair. Again and
      again she uttered the bitterest imprecations and the fiercest cries for a
      taste of youth and happiness. At length she stood up, straining her ears
      for the music in the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she screamed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I must dance once! I must kiss once! Let me be happy once! I cannot
      die before I dance! Let me go&mdash;let me dance&mdash;let me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up to her full height, her eyes glowed like live coals,
      she took a few steps towards the door&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must dance&mdash;let me dance!" she gasped, and fell stiffly forward on
      the floor&mdash;dead.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
